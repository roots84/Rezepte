I usually cook by feeling so some of the amount are indicative. Let's see. 
Start by dissolving 15 g of fresh yeast in 200 ml of water. 
Add a pinch of sugar then incorporate 350 g of flour and a teaspoon of salt. 
Don't forget the oil 50 ml (adjust with flour if sticky) 
Let rise until double in size.
Time depends much on the temperature of your environment. 
Then form a thick layer over a well oiled cooking form and let is rest for 30 min. 
Add some oil and a bit of water. Then the best. Massage it gently. 
Let it rest again and bake at 250 C for 10-15 minutes!
