150g Mehl
2 Esslöffel
2 Teelöffel Backpulver
1/2 Teelöffel Salz
1 Ei, geschlagen
250ml Milch
1 Teelöffel Öl
2 Bananen (optional)

Directions
1.	In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2.	In a seperate bowl, combine the egg, milk, and oil. Add this all at once to the flour mixture, stirring until blended but still slightly lumpy.
3.	For a standard- size pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter onto a hot, lightly greased griddle or a heavy skillet. For a dollar-sized pancake, use only about 1 Tbsp. of batter.
4.	Cook the pancakes until golden brown, flipping them over when they have a bubbly surface and slightly dry edges.
5.	To make The Rock's favorite kind of pancakes, slice the bananas into 1/4-inch slices and place them in between the layers of the pancakes.
